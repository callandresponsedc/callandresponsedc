  WASHINGTON, DC -- For three years, Call + Response has been an art show that brings together writers and visual artists. The writers provide the call with an original piece of writing and then visual artists generate an original piece of work in response, with the end result being two pieces that resonate with each other.
  <br/><br/>
Coming this fall will be its fourth iteration and we're going BIG.
 <br/><br/>
To start, we're adding the layer of music. <a href="http://restorations.bandcamp.com/">Restorations</a>, will be generating an original long-form instrumental track. Each of the dozen writers this year will receive that music as the foundation of their writing and really the foundation of the show.
 <br/><br/>
The additional twist is each piece of writing is going to be paired with two visual artists each. All the artists will also receive the music along with their paired piece of writing to work from.
 <br/><br/>
The opening will take place in Fall 2014 at <a href="http://www.holeintheskydc.com/">Hole in the Sky</a> in northeast D.C. Restorations will perform and have each piece of writing sandwiched between the two visual responses.
<br/><br/>
Our ultimate goal has always been about bringing together creative communities together and we're very excited about this iteration.
