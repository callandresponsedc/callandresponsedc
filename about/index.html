<h1>About
</h1>
<p>
Call + Response is an (almost) annual art show in the nation's capital that brings together writers and visual artists. The writers provide the call with an original piece of writing and then visual artists generate a new piece of work in response. The end result being two pieces that resonate with each other. 
  <br/><br/>
This year, we've added the layer of music, that acts as the foundation of the show. <a href="http://restorations.bandcamp.com/">Restorations</a> has created an original long-form instrumental track. Next, each of the writers received that music as a starting point for their writing. 
  <br/><br/>
Each piece of writing has been paired with a visual artist. All the artists also received the music along with their paired piece of writing to base their original creation. 
  <br/><br/>
The opening will take place on October 11, 2014 at <a href="http://www.holeintheskydc.com/">Hole in the Sky</a> in northeast D.C. Restorations will perform and each piece of writing will be displayed with their visual response. There will be a 7inch of the music packaged with all the writing from the show. (You can donate to help make that happen <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=M6CSF7PBZXWS2">HERE</a>.)
  <br/><br/>
The ultimate goal has always been about bringing together creative communities.
