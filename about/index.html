<h1>About
</h1>
<p>
  For three years, Call + Response has taken place in Washington, D.C. where writers write an original piece of writing and then visual artists create an original piece of work with the end result being two pieces that resonate with each other. Our ultimate goal has always been about bringing together creative communities that might not typically interact.
 
Coming this fall will be its fourth iteration and we're going BIG.
 
To start, we're adding the layer of music. <a href="http://restorations.bandcamp.com/">Restorations</a>, will be generating an original long-form instrumental track. Each of the dozen writers this year will receive that music as the foundation of their writing and really the foundation of the show.
 
The additional twist is each piece of writing is going to be paired with two visual artists each. All the artists will also receive the music along with their paired piece of writing to work from.
 
At the opening in October at <a href="http://www.holeintheskydc.com/">Hole in the Sky</a> in northeast D.C. we'll have the band perform and have each piece of writing sandwiched between the two visual responses.
