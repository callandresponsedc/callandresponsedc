<h1>About
</h1>
<p>
  Call + Response is an annual art show pairing
  <a href="../participants/index.html">writers and artists
  </a> to create new works with a twist. Five writers each contribute a
  call&mdash;a short piece of fiction or poetry&mdash;and five artists each create a new installation piece in
  response to one call. For the first time, this year's writers will view the artworks prior to the show's opening and respond in some way, possibly through creation, revision, or reflection, to the responses.
