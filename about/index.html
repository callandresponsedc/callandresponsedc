<h1>About
</h1>
<p>
Call + Response is an annual art show that brings writers and visual artists together to create and showcase original, joint works. For the first four iterations of the show, the writers called, and the visual artists responded with a new, little twist each year.
 <br/>
In 2015, the show will make its Baltimore debut at the EMP Collective in downtown Baltimore. Call + Response V is adding a new element this year to literally spice things up with the addition of Baltimore’s Blacksauce Kitchen who’s mission states “[…] we strive to make food that connects with our audience; food that makes someone pause; food that prompts two girls to skip towards the tent; food that makes a man dance ever so subtly because it reminds him of another time or place; food that helps people remember.”
 
THE CALL
Blacksauce Kitchen will create three distinct bites that highlight the sweet, sour, and savory flavors. All 18 of the writers and visual artists will come to EMP in early May 2015 and meet their pairing for the first time. Together, they will taste their assigned flavor profile (three pairs will have sweet bites, three pairs will have sour bites, and three pairs will have savory bites).
 
THE RESPONSE
The nine acclaimed, emerging and award-winning poets, fiction writers, journalists, and essayists largely based in Baltimore, will write short, reactive pieces that are a thousand words or less. All will be a unique, original conversation with Blacksauce and their assigned flavor profile.
 
AND THEN
Each written response will go to nine acclaimed, emerging and award-winning visual artists who will enter the conversation, too. It will be a dialogue not just with the written work, but also with the food pairing.
 
THE OPENING
At the Call + Response V opening on September 11, 2015 at the EMP Collective, the 18 pairs of works will be on display and Blacksauce will serve the bites that inspired the pairings. The audience will be able to experience the flavors that began the conversation.
