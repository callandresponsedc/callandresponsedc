<h1>About
</h1>
<p>
  Call + Response is an (almost) annual art show in the nation's capital that brings together writers and visual artists. The writers provide the call with an original piece of writing and then visual artists generate a new piece of work in response. The end result being two pieces that resonate with each other.
  <br/><br/>
Coming this fall will be its fourth iteration and it's going to be <b><I>BIG</I></b>.
 <br/><br/>
The layer of music will be added as the foundation of the show. <a href="http://restorations.bandcamp.com/">Restorations</a>, will be creating an original long-form instrumental track. Next, each of the dozen writers will receive that music as a starting point for their writing.
 <br/><br/>
Each piece of writing will be paired with two visual artists each. All the artists will also receive the music along with their paired piece of writing to base their original creation.
 <br/><br/>
The opening will take place in Fall 2014 at <a href="http://www.holeintheskydc.com/">Hole in the Sky</a> in northeast D.C. Restorations will perform and have each piece of writing sandwiched between the two visual responses. We hope to produce a 7" of the music packaged with all the writing from the show. (You can donate to help make that happen <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=M6CSF7PBZXWS2">HERE</a>.)
<br/><br/>
The ultimate goal has always been about bringing together creative communities.
